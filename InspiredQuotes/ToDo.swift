 To Do:
 
 - Swiping left will allow user to hide/unhide a quote from the watch
 
    - Use a class instead of struct for quotes?
    - Declare the Quotes as a singleton?
 
 - Change the random function to use GamePlayKit
 - Add a background for the quote on the watch
 - Add a icon for the watch
 - Add a icon for the phone
 
 Potential Issues:
 
 - What happens if a user hides all quotes from the watch?

 Done:
 
  - Build an iPhone view so all quotes are displayed in a table view
 
 
 Next version:
 
 - Add icon complication
 - Add large complication
 - Add notification (once a day)
 - user taps on a quote on the iPhone will bring up a list of other quotes from the same person
 - Allow user to search through all quotes using search bar
 - Allow user to add their own quotes
 - allow user to share a quote
